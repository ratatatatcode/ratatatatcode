**ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm James, or you can call me "ratatatatcode."**

I don't have a specific reason why I chose that username; it just sounds cool to me.

If you happen to be looking for an intern or trainee for your company, feel free to contact me. I would love to gain experience in the IT industry at this stage of my career.

ðŸ’» I possess basic knowledge of Java, Python, C++, and PHP. Currently, I am focusing on learning Javascript as my primary programming language.

I also take commissions. Feel free to message me on my Facebook account; I would love to work with you!<br>
