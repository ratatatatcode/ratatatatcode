<strong>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, James or you can call me "ratatatatcode"</strong>
I don't have any reason why I used that username. It sounds cool for me.

By any chances, you can contact me if you're looking for intern or trainee for your company.
I would love to have an experience in IT industry at this age.

ðŸ’» For now, I have some basic knowledge of Java, Python, and C++.
I am currently focusing in learning Javascript as my main programming language.
